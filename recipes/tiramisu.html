    <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert known for its layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, creamy mascarpone cheese mixture, and dusting of cocoa powder.

Often served chilled, it's a favorite at Italian restaurants and homes alike, offering a delightful combination of textures and flavors that make it perfect for rounding off a meal or celebrating special occasions.</p>
